# Stress-Detection-using-machine-learning
the model used in this project is BernoulliNB
the reason behinde using this model is the task of classfication is binary (stress or no stress)
the train accuracy of this model is 91% and test accuracy of this model is 75%. 
for increasing the accuracy we need mode dataset
